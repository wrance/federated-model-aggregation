Python Developer / Client Example
=================================

Usage of Federated Model Aggregation service
*************
A developers guide to using federated model aggregation service.

Prerequisites
*************
* Users must have a deployment of the FMA service setup and running. Directions for doing that locally can be found in this repo under :doc:`Django Deployment <django_example>` .
* As part of the system mentioned above, an admin (superuser) must be established to access the service as a developer.


Creation of initial model weights and schema
*************
* To create and serialize the dataprofiler model's initial json files, run `python3 create_initial_model_json_files.py`
* This will create two JSON files:
  - `initial_model_weights.json` contains fresh weights with the correct labels
  - `initial_model_schema.json` contains the schema for the model

Initializing a model
********************
Once you have started the service locally on your browser the service will ask you to login

* Provided users use the default deployment, `/api/v1/models` is the default endpoint users can find the model aggregation setup. The default endpoint is 
  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/models`

  - `http://127.0.0.1:8000` is swappable and may differ depending on your implementation.

  - You can edit pre-existing models here by clicking on the name of them in the list

* This will take you to a page called "Federated Model List"

  * "Initial model" field: This is where the json formatted values for your model go (usually weights from previous above step)
  * "Name" field: The name of the model aggregation
  * "Requirement" field: A dropdown list of additional requirements functions for aggregation that are explained below
  * "Requirement args": A list of arguments for the extra requirements function above
  * "Aggregator": A field to fill out the aggregation function you wish to use for your client models
  * "Developer": (should see your username)
  * "Clients" field: a selectable list that shows all the clients subscribed to your service
      - This can be left alone if there are not specific clients with which you wish to interact for this model.

* Once all relevant fields are filled out, click "POST" and your model aggregation is created.
